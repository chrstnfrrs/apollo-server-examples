# Apollo Server Examples

This repository contains examples of Apollo Servers I've made in order to get up and running with Graphql.

* **apollo-server-base** - Show's an Apollo server setup using typedefs and resolvers. This setup allows for querying, creating, and deleting fields from application state.
* **apollo-server-modules** - Show's an Apollo server setup using modules. This setup allows for querying, creating, and deleting fields from application state.
